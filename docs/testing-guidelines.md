# Testing Guidelines

## Unit Tests

- Use **Jest** to test individual functions and React components in isolation
- Test files must follow the naming convention `*.test.js` or `*.test.ts`
- Name unit test files to match what they're testing (e.g., `app.test.js` for testing `app.js`)
- Backend unit tests should be placed in `packages/backend/__tests__/`
- Frontend unit tests should be placed in `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/`

## Integration Tests

- Use **Jest + Supertest** to test backend API endpoints with real HTTP requests
- Integration tests should be placed in `packages/backend/__tests__/integration/`
- Test files must follow the naming convention `*.test.js` or `*.test.ts`
- Name integration test files intelligently based on what they test (e.g., `todos-api.test.js` for TODO API endpoints)

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- Use **Playwright** (required framework) to test complete UI workflows through browser automation
- E2E tests should be placed in `tests/e2e/`
- Test files must follow the naming convention `*.spec.js` or `*.spec.ts`
- Name E2E test files based on the user journey they test (e.g., `todo-workflow.spec.js`)
- Playwright tests must use **one browser only**
- Playwright tests must use the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern for maintainability
- Limit E2E tests to **5–8 critical user journeys** — focus on happy paths and key edge cases, not exhaustive coverage

## Port Configuration

Always use environment variables with sensible defaults for port configuration to allow CI/CD workflows to dynamically detect ports.

- **Backend**: `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3030;`
- **Frontend**: React's default port is `3000`, but can be overridden with the `PORT` environment variable
